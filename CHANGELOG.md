## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-13

First public release. StockLot ERP is a collaborative, multi-user web ERP that
replaces the monthly Excel workbook used to run a Bangladeshi StockLot (surplus /
overstock / lot apparel) wholesale business, giving a small team one source of
truth for master data, sales, dues, inventory, purchases, expenses, treasury, and
automatic profit / summary reporting. Currency is BDT (৳); the UI is English and
built for phones (market / warehouse) and desktop (office).

Built on Next.js 16 (App Router, React Server Components, TypeScript), React 19,
Prisma 6 on PostgreSQL, and Auth.js / NextAuth v5. Reconciliation-driven: the ERP
reproduces the source June '26 Excel workbook figures to the taka (e.g. 11,929 pcs
sold, ৳852,159 collected).

### Added

- Reports pack: day book, purchases report, cash flow, cash book, balance sheet.

- Installable PWA with an offline fallback.
- Bulk actions (e.g. bulk activate / deactivate styles).
- Roles: OWNER, PARTNER, SALES (Sales Operator), INVENTORY (Inventory Clerk),
  ACCOUNTANT, ADMIN.

### Security

- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** — a central capability matrix
  (`can(role, action)`) gates navigation and every server action before any read
  or write; routes are additionally gated at the edge.
- **Audit trail** — every CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE is recorded with field-level
  before / after values in an `AuditLog` table.
- **CVE-free xlsx fork** — Excel import / export uses `@e965/xlsx`, a patched,
  CVE-free fork of `xlsx`.
- **CSV injection guard** — exported CSV cells are sanitized to prevent formula
  (CSV) injection.
- Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs; sessions use JWT with the user role carried
  in the token. Every server action validates input with Zod before writing.
